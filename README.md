NOTE BE SURE TO REPLACE "RAYMOND" WITH YOUR USERNAME(directory name) OR JUST FIND THE DIRECTORY YOURSELF 

gnome-shell.css in this repository is where the custom css file for the theme lies.

Install the original theme from https://github.com/TheGreatMcPain/gruvbox-material-gtk
and replace the gnome-shell.css file in your dir 
/home/raymond/.local/share/themes/Gruvbox-Material-Dark/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css with the one in this repository 


To complete this setup get the gnome extensions:
Crucial:
"User Themes"
"Dash to Dock" (In the settings of this extensions change the following:
			  -set Icon size limit 32
			  -Go to the appearance tab 
			  -Enable shrink the dash
			  -Disable Use built-in theme
			  -Set the opacity to fixed option 
			  -Set the fixed opacity to 0%)
"Rounded Window Corners" (In the settings set the color of the window borders to: #786c58) 

Random other extensions to spice things up: 
--"Dash to Dock Animator"-- (one of my favourites)
Caffeine
Vitals 
Hide Top Bar
Blur my Shell
OpenWeather
Date Menu Formatter
Vertical Workspaces
Unite
Clipboard Indicator
Unblank lock screen
Remove Alt+Tab Delay v2
Media Controls
Launch new instance
Just Perfection
 
Possible errors: 
Note if you have "Blur my Shell" disable the effect on the top panel 
Disable the Ubuntu Dock extension, it is not needed if you use Dash to Dock

The dot files for the terminal: 

I use kitty, the kitty.config will be in the repository (this is found in .config/kitty/kitty.config ) 

I use the bash in kitty, the ".bash.rc" will be in the repository as bash.rc (because github did not accept a hidden file)
Further the the picture directory for the neofetch will have to be reset according to your machine. 

I launch starship from my bash.rc and this controls the prompts ect, my starship.toml will be in the repository 

I also launch neofetch from bash.rc and the configuration file config.conf is the the config for neofetch (is found in 
/home/raymond/.config/neofetch/)

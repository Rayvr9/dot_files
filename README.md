gnome-shell.css in this repository is where the custom css file for the theme lies.

Install the original theme from https://github.com/TheGreatMcPain/gruvbox-material-gtk <br />
and replace the gnome-shell.css file in your dir  <br />
/home/raymond/.local/share/themes/Gruvbox-Material-Dark/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css with the one in this repository 


#### To complete this setup get the gnome extensions: <br />
###### Crucial: <br />
"User Themes" <br />
"Dash to Dock" == In the settings of this extensions change the following: <br />
			  - Set Icon size limit 32 <br />
			  - Go to the appearance tab <br />
			  - Enable shrink the dash <br />

			  - Set the opacity to fixed option <br />
			  - Set the fixed opacity to 0% <br />
"Rounded Window Corners" (In the settings set the color of the window borders to: #786c58)  <br />

###### Random other extensions to spice things up:

Just Perfection <br />
 
#### Possible errors:  <br />
Note if you have "Blur my Shell" disable the effect on the top panel  <br />
Disable the Ubuntu Dock extension, it is not needed if you use Dash to Dock <br />

#### The dot files for the terminal: 

I use kitty, the kitty.config will be in the repository (this is found in .config/kitty/kitty.config ) 

I use the bash in kitty, the ".bash.rc" will be in the repository as bash.rc (because github did not accept a hidden file) <br />
Further the the picture directory for the neofetch will have to be reset according to your machine. 

I launch starship from my bash.rc and this controls the prompts ect, my starship.toml will be in the repository 

I also launch neofetch from bash.rc and the configuration file config.conf is the the config for neofetch (is found in 
/home/raymond/.config/neofetch/)
